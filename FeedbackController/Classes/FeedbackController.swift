///
/// - impact: Use this type to indicate that an impact occured. Use it for example, when UI elements collide or snap into place. It can vary between ```light```, ```medium``` and ```heavy```.
/// - selection: Use this type to indicate selection between different values. Those can be numeric or other discrete values like a switch.
/// - notification: Use this type to indicate that a task has succeded or failed. It can also be used to display a warning to the user. Usually, it uses a more complex haptics than the other types.
